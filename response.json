    "home": "[b][i]BubbleClient Hub[/i][/b]\nInstall & Update BubbleClient with ease! [b]BubbleClient[/b] â€” A powerful client that uses FabricMC as its basis with preinstalled mods and configurations. These include nice mods made by people and a build-in mod developed specifically for this client!\n\n[b][i]Why BubbleClient?[/i][/b]\n[table=1]\n[cell]Unlike other PvP Clients, BubbleClient isn't bloated, it has features perfectly polished to work the best for the player's experience according to BubbleFish.[/cell]\n[cell]You can always get support, since BubbleFish is in the same clan as you, always ready to help![/cell]\n[cell]This client is perfectly optimized for clan PvP.[/cell]\n[/table]\n\n[b][i]Features[/i][/b]\n[indent][b]Performance boosts[/b][/indent]\nYou are getting a smooth experience on both weak and powerful computers without sacrifice. You get more FPS, less memory usage, faster loading screens and more!\n\n[indent][b]Friends, Chat & Cosmetics[/b][/indent]\nMore people use this client - more will be able to chat in game. Invite to servers and use cosmetics.\n\n[indent][b]Player clans[/b][/indent]\nYou can set player clans that will make their in-game name colorful, which helps in war/big fights! To do so use '/clan set <player> <clan name>'. This mod was made by me, and automatically keeps track of player name changes\n\n[indent][b]Replaymod[/b][/indent]\nYou can record servers to report cheaters, make videos, clips. You can appeal your bans. [b]Which you can use if you don't have a recording software[/b]\n\n[indent][b]Better Ping display[/b][/indent]\nPlayer pings won't display as lines, but as numbers now. You can always see your ping by looking at top left corner as well!\n\n[indent][b]HUD[/b][/indent]\nYou can see your potion effects and when do they expire, very useful for playing wizard.\n\n[indent][b]Player Name History Lookup[/b][/indent]\nDon't remember that guy? Look his name up maybe it's your friend!\n\n[indent][b]Health indicators[/b][/indent]\nSome servers already have that. But, they display health as numbers, hearts are more intuitive, aren't they?\n\n[indent][b]Look around[/b][/indent]\nYou can hold a key to look around yourself without moving your head. Useful when running away from someone, but, are you eternal to do so?\n\n[indent][b]Emoji in chat[/b][/indent]\nYou can send emoji in chat. Instruction: [color=#3057EA][url=https://docs.google.com/document/d/1FWuPpHqQYkXnfRXXoAtagxrZlUyBaDvvLxpdS7o0ZKE/edit]How to use[/url][/color]. Those emoji will be seen by all players, not only those who use client!!\n\n[indent][b]Zoom[/b][/indent]\nYou can zoom in and out by holding a key then using your mouse wheel. Very smooth and can zoom as far as you wish.\n\n[indent][b]Toggled sprint[/b][/indent]\nYou don't have to hold Ctrl key all the time, just press it once and run forever!\n\n[indent][b]Keybinds[/b][/indent]\nYou run away from 8 people and you wish to respawn? You can press a keybind to quickly do /kill or any other (only pussies abuse it though)\n\n[indent][b]Popular mods[/b][/indent]\nYou can use sodium and lithium!\n\n[indent][b]Other tweaks[/b][/indent]\n* More chat history, no more chat lag.\n* No more narrator.\n* Screen won't shake when damage is taken, better aim! (Toggleable, because moderators didn't decide whether it is legal to use, this only changes appearance)\n* Screen tint to make you aware of low health.\n* Copy screenshot to clipboard automatically.\n* Chests, signs, etc. are 10+ (no kidding) times more optimized.\n* Cull leaves (improve performance).\n* Opening links won't freeze your game anymore.",
