# **BubbleClient Manual Installation**
*Since there were a lot of issues with automatic installation, I will try my best to describe every step you need to do to get BubbleClient installed!*

* [Features](#features)
* [How to install](#installation)


# **Features**:
## **Chat** & **Friends**
Will let you have direct connection to clan members, ask for help without opening discord!


## **Clans**
I wrote my own mod, that displays player clans in-game and in player list. This way you don't get confused whom to attack in a big fight! **This database is constantly updating**, so you get the best experience, you can also add your own players using `/clan set <Player name> <Clan name>`! Every time you launch your game it's going to download all clans and all players and cache them so you don't have to memorize them!

*(P.S. My FPS was so low because I turned on 1080p for the screenshot, while my laptop doesn't have a video card, usually I get 80-510 FPS while playing :)))*


## **Player name history lookup**
Do `/names <Player>` to get player name history in-game


## **Emoji in chat**
You get an emoji-picker in chat


## **Optimization**
Launches like a spaceship, doesn't use a lot of memory, huge FPS and balls


## **Perspective**
You can set a key to use 3-rd person without rotating your head


## **Health**
You can see player health bars above them. Can be disabled with `/bubbleclient` command. You also get a red tint when your health is low!


## **And more**
And there are a lot of tweaks that will make game much better!
